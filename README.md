It was tested only on Asus ROG STRIX G531GT and G731GU, which have 4 independent AURA zones as following:

- Zone1: keyboard, which can have only one colour
- Zone2: light-bar corners (front corners)
- Zone3: light-bar front left half and right side
- Zone4: light-bar front right half and left side

It seems that there exists AURA notebooks with 7 zones and i assume that the keyboard itself is splitted in four color zones, what i am thinking is that the above zones exists as well on the devices with 7 zones but i cannot test nor confirm.

Who wants to test this app on any other AURA device please be my guest.
But note that i am not responsible for any damage may cause :) this software is provided AS IS!

Changing the asusProductID on macAura.app/Contents/Resources/Product.plist file from 0x1866 hex or 6246 dec it allow you to test this app on different AURA devices, but note, do not use an asus productid which is not an AURA device, a good example will be an asus usb drive....
